Make components:

  - module Auth:
      Input: username + password
      Output: Refresh Token

  - module Video Meta:
      Input: Refresh token
      Output: Videos list meta data last 3 days.

  - module Video Analytic - Face Count:
      Input:
        Video ID of Ring
        Refresh Token

      Output:
        Video Anlysis Result ( By Using Google ML technology: object detection or how-its-called  )

  - Front-end:
      CLI First to ensure it works locally.

      Make PWA Web-APP that can use Phone-Notification-push + Run in Background api

      - User Sign in
      - User sees list of all videos past 3 days
      - App auto select first video of each camera, and start analyzing them
      - App show sample notification Count for each camera video.



All component is done, then:

  - deploy front-end on Firebase

  - deploy back end components to Firebase

  - Find way to connect front-end to back end seemlessly.

  - Test and go




Potentials:
  - Make ML Widgets available within app-front-end, app-front-end will tell back-end what ML model to use to analyze video.
  - get payload of each custom ML run => push to noti. as well as store it locally.
